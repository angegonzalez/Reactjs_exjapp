This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## November Updates 
Migrating this project for app: ENSEÑAME

## What about this app?
This app allows students to teach and learn in a colaborative community in universities, each person can teach in selected hours and learn too, this can be possible with a created currency called EduCoins, you will earn money as you teach and you can use it for learn other things, this creates a pay system called EduPay. 
In summary, you can teach and learn helping other students in different areas and you can step up your skills in another.

## `About programming`
Now, i'm learning about JavaScript, NodeJs, and React technologies, now i´m focused in Front-end part, and i hope you can colabore in the Back-end part.
What is the purpose?
Using a relational database ( for my learning process I use Oracle Database) and reactJS build this app with all of its functionalities:
  - Request classes ( i.e You can select Math class at 29/11/2019 16:00)
  - Teach classes (i.e You can select from a calendar your availability
  - Send money, request money ( Like a pay system where you can request and pay using the currency)
  - See classes ( in both ways, you can see the class that you teach, and the classes you will receive).
 #### Important: The heart of the app is that a person can be a teacher or a student in a global view. 

## Finally 
I will expecting all your contributions, for make this great app, and help me learn more about Back-end developing, I´m very exciting for this project, but i don´t have too much time, I hope you can understand this.
This is my first GitHub project.
